# Enhanced-Text-Image-Encryption-with-XChaCha20-and-LSB-Based-Steganography
This project implements a secure communication system that encrypts text and images using the XChaCha20 symmetric encryption algorithm and then hides the encrypted payload within cover images using Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography.
